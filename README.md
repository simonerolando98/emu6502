#  emu6502 - fast 6502 emulator in C

A simple, fast MOS 6502 emulator written entirely in C as a fun, personal project to perfect my knowledge of the C Programming Language.

## Compile and Install

The project is though as a universal Unix-based C project, needing unistd.h and some other header files and libraries present in common Unix and Unix-like operating systems.

To compile the program on Windows, you will need a transation layer like Cygwin, or better yet, you might be able to use Windows 10's new Linux substrate, the so called WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
